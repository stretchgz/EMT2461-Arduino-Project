## Read Me

This is my EMT (System Interface) project using [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) [Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno) Board.

The robotic car will move forward in a straight line and
to avoid obstacles by using Sonar/Infrared/Laser Sensor.

Additionally, we might use `Optical Encoders` to balance both motors' speed.
