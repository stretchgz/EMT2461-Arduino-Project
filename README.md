## Read Me

This is my EMT (System Interface) project to operate a robot using [Arduino](http://www.arduino.cc/) Uno Board.

The basic idea is the robotic car will move forward in a straight line and avoid obstacles by uding Sonar/Infrared/Laser Sensor.

Possibly we might use `Optical Encoders` to balance motors' speed.
